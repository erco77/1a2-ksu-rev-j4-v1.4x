1A2 SERISS KSU REV-J4, Firmware v1.4x

    This project is the Seriss KSU project; board revision REV-J4,
    and companion PIC firmware version V1.4x.

    This project is a circuit board and PIC firmware combination.
    I've created this as a separate github project, as it was too
    confusing to use git by itself to manage the different board designs
    and firmware versions.

    These boards control old AT&T / Bell System / Western Electric "1A2"
    business phone systems which were THE phones used in business from
    the 1950's on through the early 1980's.

    Some people still like using these rugged multiline phones which can
    be integrated with modern technology; IP telephones, Cellphones (via
    Bluetooth gateway devices), etc.

    The project's main website is here: http://seriss.com/1a2-ksu/rev-j4
    ..which shows how the circuit board is used, the current status of
    the PCBs, schematics, documentation, user manual, circuit description, etc.
    The project uses two PIC16F1709 chips to manage hardware logic on
    the PCB, in place of analog/discrete components used in earlier
    versions of the printed circuit board (revisions A through C).

    This github project simply manages the purely technical files needed
    to create the physical board (geber files, firmware source code), and
    low level technical documentation such as the circuit description,
    design considerations, etc.
