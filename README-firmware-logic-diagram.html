1A2 Firmware Logic Diagram
==========================

The following flowchart shows the state machine logic in CPU1's firmware
(the 'HandleLine()' function) that implements the call states for each CO line (Line #1 and #2).

The letters in quotes (next to each state in the diagram) refer to comment markers 
in the source code where each state transition is handled.
